\chapter{Summary}
The evolution of mobile communication technologies continue to expand
to fulfill the demand for better network coverage and increased
capacity, which in turn introduce many new ideas, designs and methods
to learn and comprehend.

This thesis investigates the Um interface of the \gls{GSM}, technology
by describing the design and implementation of a \gls{SDR}-driven
protocol analyzer by processing digital complex samples from the radio
link between a \gls{BTS}, and a \gls{MS}. These samples are provided
by a HackRF One \gls{SDR} and are transferred to a computer over a
\gls{USB}, interface.

By demodulating the radio signal and estimating the digital
information on the air interface, a synchronous connection can be
established and any traffic within a desired \gls{GSM} cell can be
monitored. This enables the underlying protocols for call-, mobility-
and radio control to be examined and analyzed.

The software implementation described in this thesis proposes a use in
an educational aspect for learning and comprehension of protocols used
in mobile communications.
