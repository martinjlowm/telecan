@article{barkan,
  title = {Instant ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communication},
  language = {English},
  author = {Barkan, E. and Biham, E. and Keller, N. and Boneh, D.},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {We present a very practical ciphertext-only
                  cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communication, and
                  various active attacks on the GSM protocols. These
                  attacks can even break into GSM networks that use
                  ``unbreakable'' ciphers. We describe a
                  ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few
                  dozen milliseconds of encrypted off-the-air cellular
                  conversation and finds the correct key in less than
                  a second on a personal computer. We then extend this
                  attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on
                  A5/1. We describe new attacks on the protocols of
                  networks that use A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS. These
                  attacks are based on security flaws of the GSM
                  protocols, and work whenever the mobile phone
                  supports A5/2. We emphasize that these attacks are
                  on the protocols, and are thus applicable whenever
                  the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for
                  instance they are also applicable using the
                  cryptanalysis of A5/1. Unlike previous attacks on
                  GSM that require unrealistic information, like long
                  known plaintext periods, our attacks are very
                  practical and do not require any knowledge of the
                  content of the conversation. These attacks allow
                  attackers to tap conversations and decrypt them
                  either in real-time, or at any later time. We also
                  show active attacks, such as call hijacking,
                  altering of data messages and call theft.}
